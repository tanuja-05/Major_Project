The Cyberbullying Detection System is a machine learning-based web application that detects offensive content in user posts. 
The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to detect cyberbullying and analyze user sentiments.

Key Features
âœ… User Registration & Login â€“ Users can create accounts and post messages.
âœ… Content Analysis â€“ The system detects cyberbullying using ML models.
âœ… Sentiment Analysis â€“ Uses SVM to classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral.
âœ… Admin Panel â€“ Admin can monitor users, view flagged posts, and block offenders.
âœ… Automated Moderation â€“ If a user exceeds a certain limit of offensive posts, they get blocked.

Algorithms Used
ðŸ”¹ ADABOOST, Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SGD â€“ For cyberbullying detection.
ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€“ For sentiment analysis.

System Users
ðŸ‘¤ Users: Can register, log in, and post messages.
ðŸ‘¤ Admin: Monitors offensive content, views analytics, and blocks users.

Advantages
âœ” Enhanced Security â€“ Automatic detection prevents harmful content.
âœ” Improved Moderation â€“ Admin can take action based on system reports.
âœ” Efficient Prediction â€“ Uses ML models for high accuracy.
